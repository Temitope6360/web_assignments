			<center><strong>Chelsea press conference live: 
	Frank Lampard on Sheffield United, Kante, Rudiger & Pedro injury</strong></center>


	Hello and welcome to Cobham where Frank Lampard is speaking to the media ahead of Chelsea's Premier League match with Sheffield United tomorrow.

The Blues got their campaign properly up and running last weekend with their first three points against Norwich City at Carrow Road, and will be eager for back-to-back victories.

It is a good opportunity against a side who have just come up from the Championship, however have taken to the Premier League well with some good football.

Lampard will be hoping to have a full squad to choose from this weekend, however N'Golo Kante is still a doubt for the match.

The other question mark is over Antonio Rudiger and whether he will be fit enough to feature in his first game of the season after his knee problem.

We'll get the latest from Lampard on those injury concerns and what they mean for his starting XI.

Injuries
N’Golo Kante is not fit. Continuation of his ankle injury. I had a conversation with Deschamps. Pedro is not fit, but should be the other side of the international. Rudiger will play for the U23s tonight. 

It is a setback (Kante). My focus then is to make sure that he is okay. We certainly had to get it right. We must cope as a squad and we should show that.
